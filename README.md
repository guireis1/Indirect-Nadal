# Indirect identification of the dynamics of a railway wagon using Machine Learning models

This project aims to implement a Machine Learning (ML) model capable of providing the Nadal value from information given by cheaper and easier-to-handle sensorssuch as inertial sensors. From the dynamic simulation of the rail car, the Nadal value and the accelerations of the car were obtained. From these two data sets, the ML model is trained and validated to recognize the Nadal value from unseen wagon accelerations.A comparison between different ML models, the acceleration measurement location anddifferent inputs were tested to see which combination would provide the best correlation.
